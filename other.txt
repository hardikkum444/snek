1) so first of all I have used an enum for snakeDirection
what is an enum?
enum is used to decalre a enumeration, an enum consists of some constants given by the dev, which by default are given uniqe number values 

//enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };
//Color myColor = Color::Green;

so basically I have used an enum for snake direction movements.

2) explanation of the following piece of code (why have i used it?)

code:
bool prTail = false;
                for(int k = 0;k<snakeLen;k++)
                {
                    if(snakeTailX[k] == j && snakeTailY[k] == i)
                    {
                        cout<<"o";
                        prTail = true;
                    }
                }
                if (!prTail)
                cout<<" ";
