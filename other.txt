1) so first of all I have used an enum for snakeDirection
what is an enum?
enum is used to decalre a enumeration, an enum consists of some constants given by the dev, which by default are given uniqe number values 

//enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };
//Color myColor = Color::Green;

so basically I have used an enum for snake direction movements.
